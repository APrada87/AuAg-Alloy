## This a repository of the code lines used to produce the results of our paper title "". To work with this script is neccesary to use the open sources molecular dynamics
## code LAMMPS.
## All the simulations are based on the interatomic potential EAM/alloy showed in "CuAgAu.lammps.eam"
## Simulations to produce the initial sample of the alloys is "in.Caso-Inicial-Alloy"
## Simulations to produce the initial sample of the core-shell is "in.Caso-Inicial-Core-Shell"
## Simulations to produce laser irradiation in the alloys system is "in.Impacto-Laser-Alloy"
## Simulations to produce laser irradiation in the core-shell system is "in.Impacto-Laser-Core-Shell"
